- produce ARFF and XML output files for results and inplementation. upload them to the server.

- query the server for results. IMHO we should focus on getting the data into R, not already analyzing and
visualizing it. later on we can provide convenience functions for this, but many users disagree on what
king of tool / framework they want to use. so first of all: provide data in a reasonable format (IMHO: data.frame)
example query: get all results for a task nr (e.g. 10CV on iris)
