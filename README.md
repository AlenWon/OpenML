OpenML: Open Machine Learning
=============================
## Aim
OpenML aims to create a novel ecosystem for machine learning experimentation. The current generation of machine learning 
and data mining platforms offers a wide variety of algorithms to process and model all kinds of data. They also offer 
convenient ways for running many experiments to assess, select and fine-tune algorithm performance and optimize workflows. 
On the whole, however, users only have access to their own experiments: there is no global repository for machine learning 
experiments, nor a standardized way to share experiments with other users. This means that a lot of valuable knowledge 
about machine learning techniques is lost. OpenML is an experiment sharing platform to share detailed experimental 
results with the community at large and organize them for future reuse. Moreover, it will be directly integrated in 
todayâ€™s most popular data mining tools (for now: R, KNIME, RapidMiner and WEKA). Such an easy and free exchange of 
experiments has tremendous potential to speed up machine learning research, to engender larger, more detailed studies 
and to offer accurate advice to practitioners. Finally, it will also be a valuable resource for education in machine 
learning and data mining.

## How does it work?
OpenML works much like a data mining challenge platform, such as Kaggle. Users can define *TASKS* (or challenges of you will):
well-described problems to be solved by a machine learning workflow. A task contains a set of input data, some parameters,
and a set of expected results. 

For instance, a "Supervised Classification" task will contain a dataset, an estimation procedure (e.g. 10-fold cross-validation),
an evaluation measure to optimize for, and will require you to upload a workflow together with predictions for all the
input instances. It will also provide train-test splits so that you results can be compared by those of other users. See
below for a fully detailed example.

Users can also define new *TASK TYPES* for any other machine learning task, by defining what the inputs, parameters and outputs are.
However, some task types, like supervised classification, receive additional support. For instance, when uploading predictions,
OpenML will calculate a large range of different performance metrics and store those in a database.

The OpenML database stores and links all information regarding the experiments: the datasets (although large datasets will
be hosted by MLData.org), algorithms/workflows (uploaded by the user), results (predictions and computed measures), and authors.
The OpenML website (in progress, preview at http://expdb.cs.kuleuven.be/expdb/) will allow easy querying for all this information.
Based on simple keyword queries you can look for authors, datasets, algorithms. From a dataset, you can look at all results obtained
on that dataset, for an algorithm or workflow, you can look at all results of that algorithm on different algorithms.

The key point of OpenML is that all this should be made possible with minimal effort by the user. OpenML offers a 
RESTful API for finding and downloading tasks and datasets and uploading implementations and results. This will be integrated
in key machine learning toolboxes (for now: R, KNIME, RapidMiner and WEKA), so that experiments can be run and shared at 
the click of a button. Custom libraries can also link to OpenML by using the API services they need. 

Downloading of tasks and datasets is completely open, but users will need to register on the OpenML website to upload
results.

# API Overview
Also check the auto-generated (frequently refreshed) overview at: http://expdb.cs.kuleuven.be/expdb/api/.

OpenML offers a RESTful API. Interaction with the API happens as follows:
![task.search](https://raw.github.com/joaquinvanschoren/OpenML/master/Documentation/openml.general.png)
Jump to the following scenario's:
* [Getting a machine learning task](#gettask)
* [Getting a dataset](#getdata)
* [Getting an implementation](#getimpl)
* [Authenticate user](#auth)
* [Sharing a dataset](#sharedata)
* [Sharing an implementation](#shareimpl)
* [Sharing a run](#sharerun)
* [Checking an implementation](#checkimpl)

## <a id="gettask"></a> Getting a machine learning task
![task.search](https://raw.github.com/joaquinvanschoren/OpenML/master/Documentation/openml.tasks.search.png)

The user wants the workbench to load a specific task. A task_id is sent to the API, which will return a task file, or an error if the task is unknown.

#### Service: [openml.tasks.search](http://expdb.cs.kuleuven.be/expdb/api/index.php#openml_tasks_search) 
Returns a task given a task_id. [Try it!](http://expdb.cs.kuleuven.be/expdb/api/?f=openml.tasks.search&task_id=1)

#### Returned file: [Task](https://raw.github.com/joaquinvanschoren/OpenML/master/XML/Schemas/task.xsd) 
A task defines exactly what input data is given to, and what output data is expected from the implementation. See the [XSD Schema](https://raw.github.com/joaquinvanschoren/OpenML/master/XML/Schemas/task.xsd) for details.

Example:
```xml
<oml:task xmlns:oml="http://open-ml.org/openml">
  <oml:task_id>1234</oml:task_id>
	<oml:task_type>Supervised Classification</oml:task_type>
	<oml:input name="source_data">

	</oml:input>
	<oml:input name="estimation_procedure">
		<oml:estimation_procedure>
		        <oml:type>cross-validation</oml:type>
			<oml:data_splits_id>1001</oml:data_splits_id>
			<oml:parameter name="number_repeats">2</oml:parameter>
			<oml:parameter name="number_folds">10</oml:parameter>

	</oml:input>
	<oml:input name="evaluation_measures">  
		<oml:evaluation_measures>
			<oml:evaluation_measure>predictive_accuracy</oml:evaluation_measure>
		</oml:evaluation_measures>
	</oml:input>
	<oml:output name="predictions">
		<oml:predictions>
			<oml:name>predictions</oml:name>
			<oml:format>ARFF</oml:format>
			<oml:feature name="repeat" type="integer" required="true"/>
			<oml:feature name="fold"   type="integer" required="true"/>

</oml:task>
```

### Getting train-test splits
![data.description](https://raw.github.com/joaquinvanschoren/OpenML/master/Documentation/openml.tasks.splits.png)

Some tasks define explicit train-test splits, so that results from different users can be compared. These splits are given in an ARFF file which can be directly downloaded using the data_splits_url given in the task description.

Example: For a repeated n-fold cross-validation procedure, the data splits file will state, for each of the n folds and m repeats, whether a certain row_id is in the train or test set:
```xml
@RELATION Iris_splits

@ATTRIBUTE type {TRAIN,TEST}
@ATTRIBUTE rowid STRING
@ATTRIBUTE fold INTEGER
@ATTRIBUTE repeat INTEGER

@DATA
TRAIN,140,9,1
TRAIN,123,9,1
TRAIN,110,9,1
TRAIN,137,9,1
TRAIN,104,9,1
...
```
