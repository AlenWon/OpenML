## General Documentation
The general documentation (the one you are reading now) in written in MarkDown, can be easily edited by clicking the edit button
on the top of every page. This will bring you to the file on GitHub containing the documentation source.
You can simply edit that file and commit or create a pull request.

The sources are generated by [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/), using the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
Check these docs to see what is possible in terms of styling.

When we merge your edits, we deploy the new documentation straight to [GitHub](https://openml.github.io/OpenML), where it can be checked one more time.
On regular intervals we'll also deploy new documentation to `docs.openml.org`.

## REST API
Uses Swagger.io to generate a nice web interface that also allows trying out the API calls using your own API key (when you are logged in)

- Language: YAML/JSON
- Source: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/openml/openml/1.0.0
- Result: https://www.openml.org/api_docs
- Deployment: Export from SwaggerHub, push to https://github.com/openml/website/blob/master/downloads/swagger.json

There is currently separate documentation for serving files:

- Source: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/openml/openml_file/1.0.0
- Result: https://www.openml.org/api_data_docs

## Python API
Uses Sphinx (http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) to automatically document the API.

- Language: reStructuredText
- Source: https://github.com/openml/openml-python/tree/master/doc + Docstrings in Python code
- Result: https://openml.github.io/openml-python
- Deployment: CircleCI job that runs automatically when code is updated

## R API
User docs: Uses Vignettes (knitr)

- Language: Rmarkdown
- Source: https://github.com/openml/openml-r/tree/master/vignettes
- Result: https://openml.github.io/openml-r/vignettes/OpenML.html
- Deployment: Travis job that (should) run automatically when code is updated

API docs: Uses Roxygen

- Language: Rd files
- Source: Docstrings in R code
